# Linux
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that's used in many industries and devices. It's similar to UNIX and is an alternative to proprietary operating systems like Microsoft Windows and macOS. 

## OS
- It is a type of software interface to establish communication between user and computer hardware devices. It allows user to communicate with devices and to perform desired functions. It performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
- The primary purposes of an Operating System are to enable applications (Software’s) to interact with a computer’s hardware and to manage a system’s hardware and software resources.

## Linux distribution
- A Linux distribution (also called as Linux distro) is a collection of software that is based upon the Linux kernel. It includes GNU tools, kernel, software modules, X-server, shell utilities, an installer, and it often as a package management system. It is an Open-source project where all the programmers are combined together and make some changes in the Linux kernel by compiling the codes and make it as a new Distros.
- Famous Linux distribution are: ubuntu, fedora, RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Arch Linux, Chrome OS and Debian.
- **RedHat Package Manager**
  - _RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)_
  - _fedora_ -- **Upstream of RHEL, RHEL gets update from fedora after thorugh testing $ quality assurance.**
  - _open SUSE_
- **Debian Package Manager**
  - _Debian_
  - _ubuntu_
  - _Linux Mint_ -- **Less Bloated & Less distro than Ubuntu.**

 ## Linux Architecture
 - A Linux system is divided into three main parts:
   - **Hardware** - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
   - **Linux Kernel** - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
   - **User Space** - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.
